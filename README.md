# endian.Native - A single constant that you should not use

## WARNING 1

You should probably not use this package, because you should avoid using the native byte ordering in programs!

Read this article by Rob Pike before using this package:

https://commandcenter.blogspot.fr/2012/04/byte-order-fallacy.html

You should probably first try to fix the broken code that generates
data dependent on the architecture on which it is compiled. Fix it so it
always generates code using a fixed byte order.
If you can't, see if you can detect the byte order of the data from the
data itself.


## WARNING 2

Go 1.21 has added [NativeEndian](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/binary#NativeEndian) (see proposal [#57237](https://go.dev/issue/57237)) which serves the same purpose. However that implementation has a bug: you can't use `==` to compare `binary.NativeEndian` with either `binary.BigEndian` or `binary.LittleEndian`. See [#67026](https://go.dev/issue/67026) and the proposed fix in [CL 581655](https://go.dev/cl/581655).

This package doesn't have this bug, and is compatible even with very old versions of Go.

## Usage

This package only exports a single variable containing the [byte order](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/binary#ByteOrder) of
GOARCH.

See the [encoding/binary](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/binary) package
for how to use it to read/write a binary data stream.

```go
package endian

import "encoding/binary"

var Native binary.ByteOrder
```

The implementation is ultra lightweight because it relies on build tags.
