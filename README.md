## WARNING!

You should probably not use this package!

Read this article by Rob Pike before using this package:

https://commandcenter.blogspot.fr/2012/04/byte-order-fallacy.html

You should probably first try to fix the broken code that generates
data dependent on the architecture on which it is compiled. Fix it so it
always generates code using a fixed byte order.
If you can't, see if you can detect the byte order of the data from the
data itself.

And if you ask yourself why I created this package if no one should use it,
this is because I wanted to play with build tags and `go:generate`.

## Usage

This package only exports a single variable containing the [byte order](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/binary#ByteOrder) of
GOARCH.

See the [encoding/binary](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/binary) package
for how to use it to read/write a binary data stream.

```go
package endian

import "encoding/binary"

var Native binary.ByteOrder
```

The implementation is ultra lightweight because it relies on build tags.
